As stated in past years, the City strives to utilize interfund transfers only when necessary, and in the least amount possible. Salary and benefit reimbursements from the Water Fund and Sanitation Fund total $1,833,738. This revenue line item accounts for the reimbursement of administrative salaries and benefits initially paid by the City\u2019s General Fund that are applicable to the Water & Sanitation Enterprise Funds. This Budget proposes an allocation of fund balance in the amount of $1,103,137.\n\nGENERAL FUND EXPENDITURES\n\nT his budget includes funding for a cost of living allowance (COLA) of 4.5%. Additionally, we are forecasting an increase in group health insurance expense of 8%. Property and liability insurance expense is  forecast  to  increase by  5%  as  we  have  added new  equipment  and facilities  to our insurance coverage. Once, again, we are attempting to satisfactorily forecast our energy costs for the  upcoming  year.  At  this  time,  we  feel  that  our  projections  for  gasoline  and  diesel  costs  are adequate for the  upcoming  year.  However,  due to the  constant  changing  geo-political environment in which we currently reside, we may find it necessary to adjust these projections through  the  budget  amendment  process.  We  will  carefully  monitor  the  energy  market  as  we proceed through the fiscal year. Expenditures for electricity and natural gas also comprise a large part  of  our  supplies  budget. We  anticipate  continued  gradual  increases in energy costs  as  the markets continue to evolve. We will continue to closely monitor these costs as we prepare and execute the City\u2019s Budget in the coming years. Out of an abundance of caution in coming out of the  COVID  19  pandemic,  we  have  limited  capital  expenditures  for  facilities  and  equipment  to absolutely necessary items. All eligible expenditures for capital items are being funded through our Special Purpose Local Option Sales Tax (SPLOST) funds.\n\nOTHER GENERAL FUND HIGHLIGHTS\n\neneral Administration  $ 100,000   -

Accounting records for the City\u2019s proprietary funds are maintained on an accrual basis; that is, the effects of financial transactions, events, and circumstances are recognized in the period(s) in which they occur regardless of when the cash is received or paid. The City maintains two types of proprietary funds.  Enterprise Funds account for operations that are financed and operated in a manner similar to private business. The \u201ccustomers\u201d of these operations are primarily external. Internal Service Funds account for operations that serve other funds or departments within the government on a cost-reimbursement basis.  The \u201ccustomers\u201d of these operations are internal, within the government itself.\n\niduciary Funds\n\nFiduciary Funds are used to account for assets held in trust by the City for the benefit of individuals or other entities.

All City Departments that do not operate with an earmarked source of revenue are budgeted in the General Fund. These departments include: Administration, Finance, Information Technology, City Clerk/Customer Experience, Planning, Police, Fire, Public Works, Parks and Recreation, Human Rights, Engineering/Floodwall, and Human Resources.

The City will continue to maintain the Appointive Employees Pension Fund (AEPF) in a fully funded status through sound financial management and/or annual General Fund transfers as designated in the budget document. The AEPF may be combined with the PFPF should it be determined, by the Finance Director, that such a combination is administratively more effective and/or financially prudent.\n\nJ. In fiscal year 2006, the City issued a General Obligation Bond (GOB) forthe Police and Firefighters' Pension Fund (PFPF) bringing the fund up to an actuarially sound basis; however, the multi-year recession starting in fiscal year 2009 reduced the fund's corpus leaving a new unfunded liability. Funding is provided in the General Fund of this ordinance to further address the PFPF unfunded liability.\n\nK The City will provide to all eligible employees up to a $727 per month credit (for the months of July - December 2021) to be applied to the Comprehensive Health Insurance Benefit Plan (Cafeteria Plan) as directed by the employee.

A fund is an accounting entity with a self-balancing set of accounts that records all financial transactions for government functions. Fund accounting separates funds according to their purpose and is used to meet certain accounting, legal, and contractual provisions. Funds are classified into the following categories: Governmental, Proprietary, and Fiduciary. Each classification may be further divided into separate fund types:\n\nG overnmental Funds\n\nGovernmental funds are used to account for most of the City\u2019s general activities. They are budgeted based on the modified accrual basis of accounting, which means revenues are recorded when available and measurable, and expenditures are recorded when the services or goods are received and the liabilities are incurred. Debt Service Funds and Capital Project Funds account for the activity by which they are named, debt service and capital projects, respectively.  Special revenue funds account for money that must be used for a specific purpose.  For example, all revenue and expenditures related to the City\u2019s Municipal Aid Program (MAP) are accounted for in the MAP Fund.  Finally, the General Fund is used to account for receipts and payments that do not belong to another fund.  This is often referred to as the \u201cOperating Fund.\u201d\n\n$\n\nProprietary Funds", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 6, "city": "paducah", "s3_key": "ky_paducah_22.pdf", "filename": "ky_paducah_22.pdf", "parser": "aryn", "has_table": true, "state": "ky", "has_summary": true, "year": 2022}}, {"text": "ntation is in place prior to the rental date.

This program allows eligible residents to choose their housing from the private market paying a portion of rent & utilities directly to the landlord.\n\nBeginning November 30, 2018, the City contracted with the Paducah Housing Authority to administer the HCV in order to achieve & maintain a high-level of service and increase efficiency. This partnership enabled the program to have knowledgeable backup and support staff, office facilities that better accommodate children, and one location for housing needs. On January 22, 2019, the Section 8 offices opened at 2330 Ohio Street. The high level of service of the past has continued under the new administration. Paducah Housing Authority has hired support staff and provides inspection support.

Paducah\u2019s allocation of State motor fuel tax funds has historically averaged $500,000 annually. MAP funding is based on a formula set out by the state of Kentucky. Kentucky law requires the City to account for state shared gas tax money in a separate fund. The City traditionally adds a fund transfer from the Investment Fund for the paving (streets and sidewalks) program.\n\nhe City maintains approximately 446 lane miles of streets. The Engineering Department ranks the streets in need of resurfacing, and continues the restoration of streets, curbs, gutters, and sidewalks based on the priority list established and maintained by the City Engineer and the Street Superintendent, in coordination with local public utility companies and associated capital improvement projects.\n\ntatement of Revenue and Expenditures: Municipal Aid Program Fund", "metadata": {"city": "paducah", "state": "ky", "has_summary": true, "filename": "ky_paducah_22.pdf", "parser": "aryn", "has_table": true, "chunk_index": 36, "s3_key": "ky_paducah_22.pdf", "year": 2022}}, {"text": "| 5.7 | 5.7 | 2l | -3.7 |\n| 2409 | TOTAL PARKS & RECREATION | 27 | 27.7 | 25.7 | 25.7 | Oll |\n| 2406 | BOAT DOCK | Oll | 0.3 | 0.3 | 0.3 | Oll |\n| 3011 | HUMAN RIGHTS | Oll | Oll | Oll | Oll | Oll |\n\n| 3307 | ENGINEERING | 5.3 | 5.25 | 6 | 6 | O |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 3308 | FLOOD CONTROL | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | O |\n| 3308 | GIS | Ol | Ol | Ol | Ol | Ol |\n| 3308 | TOTAL EPW -

A fund is an accounting entity with a self-balancing set of accounts that records all financial transactions for government functions. Fund accounting separates funds according to their purpose and is used to meet certain accounting, legal, and contractual provisions. Funds are classified into the following categories: Governmental, Proprietary, and Fiduciary. Each classification may be further divided into separate fund types:\n\nG overnmental Funds\n\nGovernmental funds are used to account for most of the City\u2019s general activities. They are budgeted based on the modified accrual basis of accounting, which means revenues are recorded when available and measurable, and expenditures are recorded when the services or goods are received and the liabilities are incurred. Debt Service Funds and Capital Project Funds account for the activity by which they are named, debt service and capital projects, respectively.  Special revenue funds account for money that must be used for a specific purpose.  For example, all revenue and expenditures related to the City\u2019s Municipal Aid Program (MAP) are accounted for in the MAP Fund.

The initiation of the FY 17-18 budget begins with discussions of long-term funding objectives and concerns  between  the  City  Manager  and  Department  Directors.  This  provides  a  direction  in developing  a  basis  for  the  five  different  fund  categories,  which  are  further  defined  by  their purpose  and  need.  The  City  Manager  uses  council  goals  and  strategic  plans,  previous  years\u2019 history,  current  budget,  and  revised  projections  of  the  current  budget  to  propose  an  initial version  of  the  FY  17-18  budget  to  Budget  Commission.  Budget  Commission  then  makes  their recommendation to City Council based on input from City staff and the public. Finally, City Council makes their final amendments, if necessary, within a public hearing as required by State Law and\n\nstages of each fund within each of the five different fund categories.\n\nCurrent Revenue-by Fund Type*\n\nEnterprise (Uti l ities & Ai rport) 29% General 51% Special Revenue 20%\n\n*Internal Service, Capital Const., and Debt Service Funds are excluded as they are funded by the other City funds' current revenue sources.\n\nOperating Expenditure Budget by Fund Type\n\nGeneral 48% Special Revenue 18% Ca p Cons t/Debt/Perm Funds 0% Enterprise Internal Svc. 22% 12%\n\nFY 17-18 ADOPTED BUDGET -

To see this more clearly, a like-to-like comparison can be achieved by removing the Special Projects and IT staff budget from the FY 16-17 numbers above. That results in a FY 16-17 operating budget of $25,735,210. With this new base to compare to, the total FY 17-18 Adopted Budget increases by 0.6% over the previous fiscal year.

The most significant change to the budget is in staffing. Three full time technical positions, previously in other departments, have been absorbed by the IT Department as part of an  ongoing  effort  to  streamline  and  centralize  IT  services.  In  addition,  some  roles  have  been converted to provide a more robust and effective Department. A Project Manager and Operations Supervisor have been created to replace vacant positions, and provide additional services. The GIS  group,  which  includes  1.0  FTE,  an  intern,  and  several  contracts,  have  moved  from  Public Works into the IT Department.
