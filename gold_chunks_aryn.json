The schedule presents the out- year projections in the context of recent and current financial activity, including one prior year.\n\nThe City regularly utilizes the Five Year Plan to aid in decisions that may affect long-term revenue or expenditures, such as proposed labor agreements, or to evaluate the fiscal impact of unanticipated events. The tool is also utilized as a benchmark during the Midyear Budget Revision process, when actual trends are measured against adopted budget.\n\nDue to the unprecedented nature of COviD-19, the Five Year forecasting process for fiscal year 2020-21 had been quite a challenge. Various assumptions were based on economic indicators during the preparation of the budget.\n\nevenue\n\nRevenue projections are prepared individually for each revenue source, and assumptions and source data for the projections vary widely.", "metadata": {"state": "ca", "filename": "ca_vallejo_21.pdf", "chunk_index": 29, "year": 2021, "has_summary": true, "has_table": true, "s3_key": "ca_vallejo_21.pdf", "parser": "aryn", "city": "vallejo"}}, {"text": "3 |\n| Road Maintenance/Rehab Act | 342,206 | 1,820,000 | (1,804,500) | 357,706 |\n| Waterfront History Park |  | -

CFD costs are also anticipated to decrease in FY 2020-21.\n\nAuthorized Positions\n\nThere are no changes to the FY 2020-21 Full Time Equivalent (FTE) Mare Island 2002 CFD Fund positions as compared to FY 2019-20.\n\n+ E LT\n\nCity of VALLEJO California\n\nEconomic Development Division Mare Island Community Facilities District #2002-1\n\nThis schedule presents the CFD cash flow by month\n\n|  |  |  |  | FY 2020-2021 Adopted Budget | FY 2020-2021 Adopted Budget | FY 2020-2021 Adopted Budget | FY 2020-2021 Adopted Budget | FY 2020-2021 Adopted Budget | FY 2020-2021 Adopted Budget | FY 2020-2021 Adopted Budget |\n|  | Audited FY 18-19 | Adopted FY 19-20 | Revised FY 19-20 | Annual Budget | July | August | September | October | November | December |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 1-20 (a) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Revenues | Revenues | Revenues | Revenues | Revenues | Revenues | Revenues | Revenues | Revenues | Revenues | Revenues |\n| General taxes/fees | $ 1,439,700 | $ 1,496,231 | $ 1,496,231 | $ 1,406,465 | $ 88,002 | $ 88,002 | $ 88,002 | $ 88,002 | $ 88,002 | $ 88,002 |\n| Special Taxes | Special Taxes | Special Taxes | Special Taxes | Special Taxes | Special Taxes | Special Taxes | Special Taxes | Special Taxes | Special Taxes | Special Taxes |\n| County/Teeter | 2,426,509 | 1,928,292 | 1,928,292 | -

To implement these goals, the PDs Department efficiently facilitates the development review and inspection process, and protects the health and safety of the community.\n\nServices Provided\n\nThe Planning and Development Services Department consists of Department Administration and two divisions; the Planning Division and the Building Division.\n\nDepartment Administration\n\nResponsible for overall departmental management of the two core divisions, including budget oversight, facilitation of coordinated efforts within the Department and with other departments and agencies, and development and implementation of department-wide performance management efforts. In addition, Administration staffoversee Department-wide objectives such as customer service improvements, process efficiency enhancements, and grant procurement for multi-disciplinarylong-range policy efforts.\n\nPlanning Division\n\nAssists the community to establish its vision of the future and recommends appropriate regulations and standards to achieve that vision. The division facilitates the entitlement process so that people wishing to invest in the community can successfully and efficiently do so. Over the next year, the Planning Division will be completing its revision of the Zoning Code to implement the General Plan 2040 adopted in August 2017. Planning Division staff help applicants through the development review process, including use permits, site development permits, sign permits, tentative maps, and other land use entitlements.

Once, again, we are attempting to satisfactorily forecast our energy costs for the  upcoming  year.  At  this  time,  we  feel  that  our  projections  for  gasoline  and  diesel  costs  are adequate for the  upcoming  year.  However,  due to the  constant  changing  geo-political environment in which we currently reside, we may find it necessary to adjust these projections through  the  budget  amendment  process.  We  will  carefully  monitor  the  energy  market  as  we proceed through the fiscal year. Expenditures for electricity and natural gas also comprise a large part  of  our  supplies  budget. We  anticipate  continued  gradual  increases in energy costs  as  the markets continue to evolve. We will continue to closely monitor these costs as we prepare and execute the City\u2019s Budget in the coming years. Out of an abundance of caution in coming out of the  COVID  19  pandemic,  we  have  limited  capital  expenditures  for  facilities  and  equipment  to absolutely necessary items. All eligible expenditures for capital items are being funded through our Special Purpose Local Option Sales Tax (SPLOST) funds.\n\nOTHER GENERAL FUND HIGHLIGHTS\n\neneral Administration  $ 100,000   -

As stated in past years, the City strives to utilize interfund transfers only when necessary, and in the least amount possible. Salary and benefit reimbursements from the Water Fund and Sanitation Fund total $1,833,738. This revenue line item accounts for the reimbursement of administrative salaries and benefits initially paid by the City\u2019s General Fund that are applicable to the Water & Sanitation Enterprise Funds. This Budget proposes an allocation of fund balance in the amount of $1,103,137.\n\nGENERAL FUND EXPENDITURES\n\nT his budget includes funding for a cost of living allowance (COLA) of 4.5%. Additionally, we are forecasting an increase in group health insurance expense of 8%. Property and liability insurance expense is  forecast  to  increase by  5%  as  we  have  added new  equipment  and facilities  to our insurance coverage. Once, again, we are attempting to satisfactorily forecast our energy costs for the  upcoming  year.  At  this  time,  we  feel  that  our  projections  for  gasoline  and  diesel  costs  are adequate for the  upcoming  year.  However,  due to the  constant  changing  geo-political environment in which we currently reside, we may find it necessary to adjust these projections through  the  budget  amendment  process.  We  will  carefully  monitor  the  energy  market  as  we proceed through the fiscal year. Expenditures for electricity and natural gas also comprise a large part  of  our  supplies  budget. We  anticipate  continued  gradual  increases in energy costs  as  the markets continue to evolve. We will continue to closely monitor these costs as we prepare and execute the City\u2019s Budget in the coming years. Out of an abundance of caution in coming out of the  COVID  19  pandemic,  we  have  limited  capital  expenditures  for  facilities  and  equipment  to absolutely necessary items. All eligible expenditures for capital items are being funded through our Special Purpose Local Option Sales Tax (SPLOST) funds.\n\nOTHER GENERAL FUND HIGHLIGHTS\n\neneral Administration  $ 100,000   -

The \u201ccustomers\u201d of these operations are primarily external. Internal Service Funds account for operations that serve other funds or departments within the government on a cost-reimbursement basis.  The \u201ccustomers\u201d of these operations are internal, within the government itself.\n\niduciary Funds\n\nFiduciary Funds are used to account for assets held in trust by the City for the benefit of individuals or other entities. The City\u2019s fiduciary funds are made up of the City\u2019s two pension funds: Appointive Employee Pension Fund (AEPF) and Police and Fire Pension Fund (PFPF). These funds are accounted for on the accrual basis of accounting.\n\nFINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STRUCTURE\n\nGovernmental Proprietary Fiduciary Funds Funds Funds  Debt Service Internal Service Enterprise General Fund AEPF PFPF Fund Funds Funds Fleet Special Capital Project Solid Waste Civic Center Maintenance Fleet Trust Fund Revenue Funds Funds Fund Fund Fund Other Trust Funds Rental Property Capital Projects Health Radio Fund Bond Fund Insurance Fund Fund Fund Insurance Fund Transient Boat Dock Fund Municipal Aid E911 Fund Program Fund Investment CDBG Fund Fund Court Awards Transient Room Fund Tax Fund\n\nGOVERNMENTAL FUNDS GENERAL FUND\n\nGovernmental funds are used to account for resources traditionally associated with government which are not required legally or by sound financial management to be accounted for in another fund. All City Departments that do not operate with an earmarked source of revenue are budgeted in the General Fund. These departments include: Administration, Finance, Information Technology, City Clerk/Customer Experience, Planning, Police, Fire, Public Works, Parks and Recreation, Human Rights, Engineering/Floodwall, and Human Resources. The General Fund is the largest fund within the City of Paducah; the majority of the budget can be found within the General Fund.\n\nGENERAL FUND STATEMENT OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURES", "metadata": {"state": "ky", "s3_key": "ky_paducah_22.pdf", "parser": "aryn", "has_table": false, "filename": "ky_paducah_22.pdf", "city": "paducah", "has_summary": true, "chunk_index": 7, "year": 2022}}, {"text": "s.

A fund is an accounting entity with a self-balancing set of accounts that records all financial transactions for government functions. Fund accounting separates funds according to their purpose and is used to meet certain accounting, legal, and contractual provisions. Funds are classified into the following categories: Governmental, Proprietary, and Fiduciary. Each classification may be further divided into separate fund types:\n\nG overnmental Funds\n\nGovernmental funds are used to account for most of the City\u2019s general activities. They are budgeted based on the modified accrual basis of accounting, which means revenues are recorded when available and measurable, and expenditures are recorded when the services or goods are received and the liabilities are incurred. Debt Service Funds and Capital Project Funds account for the activity by which they are named, debt service and capital projects, respectively.  Special revenue funds account for money that must be used for a specific purpose.  For example, all revenue and expenditures related to the City\u2019s Municipal Aid Program (MAP) are accounted for in the MAP Fund.  Finally, the General Fund is used to account for receipts and payments that do not belong to another fund.  This is often referred to as the \u201cOperating Fund.\u201d\n\n$\n\nProprietary Funds", "metadata": {"has_summary": true, "s3_key": "ky_paducah_22.pdf", "filename": "ky_paducah_22.pdf", "parser": "aryn", "state": "ky", "chunk_index": 6, "year": 2022, "has_table": true, "city": "paducah"}}, {"text": "ntation is in place prior to the rental date.

This program allows eligible residents to choose their housing from the private market paying a portion of rent & utilities directly to the landlord.\n\nBeginning November 30, 2018, the City contracted with the Paducah Housing Authority to administer the HCV in order to achieve & maintain a high-level of service and increase efficiency. This partnership enabled the program to have knowledgeable backup and support staff, office facilities that better accommodate children, and one location for housing needs. On January 22, 2019, the Section 8 offices opened at 2330 Ohio Street. The high level of service of the past has continued under the new administration. Paducah Housing Authority has hired support staff and provides inspection support.

Paducah\u2019s allocation of State motor fuel tax funds has historically averaged $500,000 annually. MAP funding is based on a formula set out by the state of Kentucky. Kentucky law requires the City to account for state shared gas tax money in a separate fund. The City traditionally adds a fund transfer from the Investment Fund for the paving (streets and sidewalks) program.\n\nhe City maintains approximately 446 lane miles of streets. The Engineering Department ranks the streets in need of resurfacing, and continues the restoration of streets, curbs, gutters, and sidewalks based on the priority list established and maintained by the City Engineer and the Street Superintendent, in coordination with local public utility companies and associated capital improvement projects.\n\ntatement of Revenue and Expenditures: Municipal Aid Program Fund", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 36, "has_summary": true, "state": "ky", "city": "paducah", "parser": "aryn", "year": 2022, "has_table": true, "filename": "ky_paducah_22.pdf", "s3_key": "ky_paducah_22.pdf"}}, {"text": "| 5.7 | 5.7 | 2l | -3.7 |\n| 2409 | TOTAL PARKS & RECREATION | 27 | 27.7 | 25.7 | 25.7 | Oll |\n| 2406 | BOAT DOCK | Oll | 0.3 | 0.3 | 0.3 | Oll |\n| 3011 | HUMAN RIGHTS | Oll | Oll | Oll | Oll | Oll |\n\n| 3307 | ENGINEERING | 5.3 | 5.25 | 6 | 6 | O |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 3308 | FLOOD CONTROL | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | O |\n| 3308 | GIS | Ol | Ol | Ol | Ol | Ol |\n| 3308 | TOTAL EPW -

This section also contains the City\u2019s mission statement and core beliefs, the official ordinance adopting the FY2022 Budget, and the City\u2019s Organization and Staffing Chart.\n\nT he Financial/Operational section describes various aspects of the City\u2019s organization. This information is grouped first by fund and then by department. Like most local governments, the City of Paducah uses the fund method of accounting. Simply stated, a fund is a unit of the City which tracks the application of various public resources. For example, the Radio Fund is established to keep track of the use of the City\u2019s 800MHz radio system. Most people are particularly interested in the General Fund which is comprised of most of the City\u2019s operations such as Police, Fire, and Parks. The adopted FY2022 Budget is presented for every fund. The statements show the fund\u2019s financial condition over a number of years. Each fund statement begins with the actual audited revenue and expenditure amounts for the 2019 and 2020 fiscal years. The revised column reflects year to date budgeted revenue and expenditure amounts in the 2021 fiscal year. Finally, the adopted column reflects the 2022 fiscal year proposed budgeted amounts. Within each fund there are departments which further describe a component of the City\u2019s organization. Each department is presented with its mission statement, a history of staffing for the department and/or fund, the department\u2019s accomplishments from the outgoing fiscal year, goals for the upcoming fiscal year, and a table detailing its specific budget numbers.\n\nT he Statistical & Supplemental Information section provides the history of and the statistical information about the City of Paducah.\n\ninally, various appendices are presented towards the end of the document which more fully describe the budget process.\n\nJune 30, 2021\n\nMayor Bray and the Honorable Board of Commissioners:\n\nhe preparation and compilation of the City Manager\u2019s Adopted Budget began in January 2021. Team Paducah worked numerous hours over the past six months to construct this budget document. I am pleased to report that Team Paducah successfully met all scheduling requirements and was able to put forth a balanced budget for FY2022. This adopted budget meets all our financial obligations for FY2022 and still includes an adequate financial reserve, while purposefully aligning our fiscal resources with the following Board of Commissioners\u2019 adopted priorities:\n\n1.  Minority Inclusion\n\n2.  Downtown\n\n3.  Southside Enhancements\n\n4.  Remote Workers Incentive Program\n\n5.  Communications Enhancement\n\n6.  City Facilities\n\n7.  Annexation\n\nhe budget process employed by the City this year was a modified version of the meetings conducted last year.  Most remained virtual due to the COVID19 Pandemic protocols, but the meetings between the Finance Team, the City Manager\u2019s Office, and the Individual elected officials occurred in person.  Social distancing was observed in the City\u2019s Team Room throughout these in-person meetings. This approved budget is driven by one of the City\u2019s core organizational values: \u201cFiscal Responsibility.\u201d We worked collaboratively with each department to keep this year\u2019s budget as close to last year\u2019s budget as possible, while still striving to be \u201cAction-Oriented\u201d in the provision of our core services. After these meetings concluded we conducted an in-person budget workshop where the details of the budget were shared with the public.\n\nF Y2021 continued to be a year of adjustment for the City. We maintained a hiring freeze for most of our open positions throughout the year. We experienced a slow exodus from the COVID19 Pandemic. We observed a slow local economic rebound. We also experienced a Mayoral Election that saw the installation of Mayor George Bray as our new Mayor and the seating of 3 new Commissioners.", "metadata": {"parser": "aryn", "s3_key": "ky_paducah_22.pdf", "year": 2022, "has_table": false, "state": "ky", "city": "paducah", "has_summary": true, "chunk_index": 1, "filename": "ky_paducah_22.pdf"}}, {"text": "|  |  |  |  |  |  | 85,945 |\n| Human Rights | 17,030 |  |  |  |  |  |  | 17,030 |\n| Engineering | 1,693,485 | - |  |  |  |  |  | 1,693,485 |\n| Human Resources | 499,915 |  |  |  |  |  |  | 499,915 |\n| Investment Fund |  | 1,041,480 |  |  |  |  |  | 1,041,480 |\n| E911 |  | 2,313,380 |  |  |  |  |  | 2,313,380 |\n| Solid Waste | - | = |  |  |  |  |  | 0 |\n| Pensions |  |  |  |  |  |  | 1,100.825 | 1,100,825 |\n| Fund Transfers Out | 2,522,605 | 4,873,785 |  |  | 359,115 | 70,000 |  | 7,825,505 |\n| Total Expenditures | S 40,383,175 | S 11,471,575 | $ 1,435,000 | S 3,640,640 | $ 6,596,120 | $ 7,496,740 | $ 1,100,825 | $ 72,124,075 |\n| Reserves Utilized | S (3,675,395) | S (292.765) | $ | $ 4,370 | $ (1,741,360) | S (880.825) | $ (416,110) | S (7,002,085) |\n\nVISION, MISSION AND VALUES\n\nV ision Statement\n\nPaducah is a city where people strive to reach their full potential through lifelong learning, healthy lifestyle, creativity, culture, and compassion for one another.\n\nission Statement\n\nThe City of Paducah is mission-drive and values based.

A fund is an accounting entity with a self-balancing set of accounts that records all financial transactions for government functions. Fund accounting separates funds according to their purpose and is used to meet certain accounting, legal, and contractual provisions. Funds are classified into the following categories: Governmental, Proprietary, and Fiduciary. Each classification may be further divided into separate fund types:\n\nG overnmental Funds\n\nGovernmental funds are used to account for most of the City\u2019s general activities. They are budgeted based on the modified accrual basis of accounting, which means revenues are recorded when available and measurable, and expenditures are recorded when the services or goods are received and the liabilities are incurred. Debt Service Funds and Capital Project Funds account for the activity by which they are named, debt service and capital projects, respectively.  Special revenue funds account for money that must be used for a specific purpose.  For example, all revenue and expenditures related to the City\u2019s Municipal Aid Program (MAP) are accounted for in the MAP Fund.  Finally, the General Fund is used to account for receipts and payments that do not belong to another fund.  This is often referred to as the \u201cOperating Fund.\u201d\n\n$\n\nProprietary Funds", "metadata": {"parser": "aryn", "has_summary": true, "city": "paducah", "has_table": true, "year": 2022, "chunk_index": 6, "s3_key": "ky_paducah_22.pdf", "state": "ky", "filename": "ky_paducah_22.pdf"}}, {"text": "rvices | $213,213 | $185,034 | 0 | 0 |\n| Commodities | $2,233,066 | $2,137,100 | 0 | 0 |\n| Capital Outlay | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Total Dept.

This program allows eligible residents to choose their housing from the private market paying a portion of rent & utilities directly to the landlord.\n\nBeginning November 30, 2018, the City contracted with the Paducah Housing Authority to administer the HCV in order to achieve & maintain a high-level of service and increase efficiency. This partnership enabled the program to have knowledgeable backup and support staff, office facilities that better accommodate children, and one location for housing needs. On January 22, 2019, the Section 8 offices opened at 2330 Ohio Street. The high level of service of the past has continued under the new administration. Paducah Housing Authority has hired support staff and provides inspection support. The contract between the City and Paducah Housing Authority came to an end in November 2020.\n\nStaffing Summary: Section 8 Fund\n\n|  | Actual | Actual | Revised | Proposed |\n|  | FY2019 | FY2020 | FY2021 | FY2022 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Section 8 | Section 8 | Section 8 | Section 8 | Section 8 |\n| Housing Coordinator | 0.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 0.0 |\n| Section 8 Program Admin. | 1.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |\n| Housing Specialist | 1.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |\n| Planner I | 1.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |\n| TOTAL | 3.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 0.0 |\n\ntatement of Revenue and Expenditures: Section 8 Fund\n\n|  | Actual FY2019 | Actual FY2020 | Revised FY2021 | Proposed FY2022 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Revenue Grants | $126,899 | $91,507 | $95,545 | 0 |\n| Total Revenue | $126,899 | $91,507 | $95,545 | 0 |\n| Expenditures | Expenditures | Expenditures | Expenditures | Expenditures |\n| Personal Services | $107,833 | $86,537 | $88,710 | 0 |\n| Contractual | $14,270 | $4,577 | $4,665 | 0 |\n| Services | Services | Services | Services | Services |\n| Commodities | $4,802 | $394 | $450 | 0 |\n| Total Expenditures | $126,905 | $91,508 | $93,825 | 0 |\n\nINTERNAL SERVICE FUNDS Internal Service Funds are used to accumulate and allocate costs internally among the City\u2019s various functions.

It was authorized by the Kentucky Revised Statues. The fund was put in place to cover all civil service employees of the City of Paducah except police and fire fighters, which have their own retirement plan. Starting in 1975, eligible employees voted to migrate into the Kentucky County Employees Retirement System (CERS) which is administered by the State of Kentucky. The AEPF plan closed to any new members following the 1975 CERS vote.\n\nn the past, the AEPF\u2019s source of funding has been from investments; however, all Fund assets were exhausted by the end of FY2016. Future funding will come from the General Fund for the remaining life of the Fund for the remaining pensioner.\n\ntatement of Revenue and Expenditures: AEPF Fund\n\n|  | Actual FY2019 | Actual | Revised FY2021 | Proposed FY2022 |\n|  |  | FY2020 |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Revenue | Revenue | Revenue | Revenue | Revenue |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| Interfund Transfers | $13,459 | $13,386 | $13,625 | $13,665 |\n| General Fund |  |  |  |  |\n| Total Revenue | $13,459 | $13,386 | $13,625 | $13,665 |\n| Expenditures | Expenditures | Expenditures | Expenditures | Expenditures |\n| Personal Services | $10,372 | $10,372 | $10,375 | $10,375 |\n| Contractual Services | $3,073 | $3,000 | $3,220 | $3,305 |\n| Commodities | $14 | $14 | $30 | $20 |\n| Total Expenditures | $13,459 | $13,386 | $13,625 | $13,700 |\n\nFund Mission:\n\nPOLICE & FIRE PENSION FUND (PFPF)\n\nThe Police and Fire Pension Fund (PFPF) of the City of Paducah was created in 1956 to provide retirement, disability, and death benefits for police and fire fighters and their beneficiaries.

Accounting records for the City\u2019s proprietary funds are maintained on an accrual basis; that is, the effects of financial transactions, events, and circumstances are recognized in the period(s) in which they occur regardless of when the cash is received or paid. The City maintains two types of proprietary funds.  Enterprise Funds account for operations that are financed and operated in a manner similar to private business. The \u201ccustomers\u201d of these operations are primarily external. Internal Service Funds account for operations that serve other funds or departments within the government on a cost-reimbursement basis.  The \u201ccustomers\u201d of these operations are internal, within the government itself.\n\niduciary Funds\n\nFiduciary Funds are used to account for assets held in trust by the City for the benefit of individuals or other entities.

The Debt Service Fund currently accounts for the activity in around a dozen notes/bond issues outstanding as of the end of the fiscal year. Final maturity dates on these debt issues range from FY2024 to FY2040. The primary funding source for debt service payments is the Investment Fund, although there are also other income sources including General Fund, E911 Fund, as well as the County Transient Room Taxes.\n\nursuant to \u00a7158 of the Kentucky Constitution, the City shall not incur net general obligation indebtedness to an amount exceeding 10% of the value of taxable property within the City as estimated by the last certified assessment previous to the incurring of the indebtedness.  The City\u2019s current legal debt margin is $210,849,660.  The City\u2019s projected net general obligation indebtedness of $42.3 million at June 30, 2022 is well within this limit.\n\nn addition, per Administrative Policy FIN-27, the annual debt service requirement, which includes principal and interest, shall not exceed 10% of General Fund revenues. For FY2022, the City\u2019s net debt service payments ($3.6 million gross, less $655 thousand provided by other funding sources) will be approximately 8.1% of General Fund revenues.

They negotiate and process payments from the Insurance Fund for expenditures related to liability, workers\u2019 compensation, property insurance, and deductibles.\n\ntaffing Summary: Human Resources and Risk\n\n|  | Actual | Actual | Revised |  |\n|  | FY2019 |  |  | Proposed |\n|  |  | FY2020 | FY2021 | FY2022 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Director of HR | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 1.0 |\n| HR/Risk Director | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 0.0 |\n| Risk Manager | 0.0 | 0.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 |\n| HR Generalist | 2.0 | 2.0 | 2.0 | 1.0 |\n| Administrative Assistant | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 1.0 |\n| TOTAL | 3.0 | 3.0 | 4.0 | 4.0 |\n\nY2021 Accomplishments:\n\n\u27a2  One LOVE Award given in the Department\n\n\u27a2  Completed City-wide compensation study with appropriate adjustments made\n\n\u27a2  New Compensation Policies were adopted\n\n\u27a2  Updated the Wellness Program\n\n\u27a2  Collective Bargaining Negotiations with AFSCME\n\n\u27a2  Health Insurance costs have remained flat over the past 10 years\n\n\u27a2  Began regular scheduled bi-monthly Safety Committee Meetings\n\nFY2022 Goals:\n\n\u27a2  Munis HR module implementation\n\n\u27a2  Safety Teams: Overall reduction of accidents by 10% thru the development of safe work procedures and practices\n\n\u27a2  Onboard a Risk Manager\n\n\u27a2  City-wide Diversity & Inclusion training\n\n\u27a2  Policy & Procedure Manual review\n\n\u27a2  Updating our MSDS sheets to SDS sheets\n\nPOTENTIAL LEADERSHIP EMPLOYEE HUMAN RESOURCES PERFORMANCE SKILL RECRUITING RESEARCH TRAINING\n\nudget Summary: Human Resources and Risk Management", "metadata": {"parser": "aryn", "state": "ky", "s3_key": "ky_paducah_22.pdf", "year": 2022, "city": "paducah", "filename": "ky_paducah_22.pdf", "chunk_index": 32, "has_table": true, "has_summary": false}}, {"text": "2022 Fiscal Year Budget. This section also contains the City\u2019s mission statement and core beliefs, the official ordinance adopting the FY2022 Budget, and the City\u2019s Organization and Staffing Chart.\n\nT he Financial/Operational section describes various aspects of the City\u2019s organization. This information is grouped first by fund and then by department. Like most local governments, the City of Paducah uses the fund method of accounting. Simply stated, a fund is a unit of the City which tracks the application of various public resources. For example, the Radio Fund is established to keep track of the use of the City\u2019s 800MHz radio system. Most people are particularly interested in the General Fund which is comprised of most of the City\u2019s operations such as Police, Fire, and Parks. The adopted FY2022 Budget is presented for every fund. The statements show the fund\u2019s financial condition over a number of years. Each fund statement begins with the actual audited revenue and expenditure amounts for the 2019 and 2020 fiscal years. The revised column reflects year to date budgeted revenue and expenditure amounts in the 2021 fiscal year. Finally, the adopted column reflects the 2022 fiscal year proposed budgeted amounts. Within each fund there are departments which further describe a component of the City\u2019s organization. Each department is presented with its mission statement, a history of staffing for the department and/or fund, the department\u2019s accomplishments from the outgoing fiscal year, goals for the upcoming fiscal year, and a table detailing its specific budget numbers.\n\nT he Statistical & Supplemental Information section provides the history of and the statistical information about the City of Paducah.\n\ninally, various appendices are presented towards the end of the document which more fully describe the budget process.\n\nJune 30, 2021\n\nMayor Bray and the Honorable Board of Commissioners:\n\nhe preparation and compilation of the City Manager\u2019s Adopted Budget began in January 2021. Team Paducah worked numerous hours over the past six months to construct this budget document. I am pleased to report that Team Paducah successfully met all scheduling requirements and was able to put forth a balanced budget for FY2022. This adopted budget meets all our financial obligations for FY2022 and still includes an adequate financial reserve, while purposefully aligning our fiscal resources with the following Board of Commissioners\u2019 adopted priorities:\n\n1.  Minority Inclusion\n\n2.  Downtown\n\n3.  Southside Enhancements\n\n4.  Remote Workers Incentive Program\n\n5.  Communications Enhancement\n\n6.  City Facilities\n\n7.  Annexation\n\nhe budget process employed by the City this year was a modified version of the meetings conducted last year.  Most remained virtual due to the COVID19 Pandemic protocols, but the meetings between the Finance Team, the City Manager\u2019s Office, and the Individual elected officials occurred in person.  Social distancing was observed in the City\u2019s Team Room throughout these in-person meetings. This approved budget is driven by one of the City\u2019s core organizational values: \u201cFiscal Responsibility.\u201d We worked collaboratively with each department to keep this year\u2019s budget as close to last year\u2019s budget as possible, while still striving to be \u201cAction-Oriented\u201d in the provision of our core services. After these meetings concluded we conducted an in-person budget workshop where the details of the budget were shared with the public.\n\nF Y2021 continued to be a year of adjustment for the City. We maintained a hiring freeze for most of our open positions throughout the year. We experienced a slow exodus from the COVID19 Pandemic. We observed a slow local economic rebound. We also experienced a Mayoral Election that saw the installation of Mayor George Bray as our new Mayor and the seating of 3 new Commissioners.", "metadata": {"filename": "ky_paducah_22.pdf", "state": "ky", "s3_key": "ky_paducah_22.pdf", "has_table": false, "chunk_index": 1, "has_summary": true, "parser": "aryn", "city": "paducah", "year": 2022}}, {"text": "City of Paducah Annual Budget Fiscal Year 2022\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n| How to Read This Document |\n| --- |\n| City Manager's Budget Message |\n| Budget Ordinance |\n| City Mission & Core Beliefs |\n| Directory |\n| Staff Organizational Chart |\n| Budgeted Depart.

The initiation of the FY 17-18 budget begins with discussions of long-term funding objectives and concerns  between  the  City  Manager  and  Department  Directors.  This  provides  a  direction  in developing  a  basis  for  the  five  different  fund  categories,  which  are  further  defined  by  their purpose  and  need.  The  City  Manager  uses  council  goals  and  strategic  plans,  previous  years\u2019 history,  current  budget,  and  revised  projections  of  the  current  budget  to  propose  an  initial version  of  the  FY  17-18  budget  to  Budget  Commission.  Budget  Commission  then  makes  their recommendation to City Council based on input from City staff and the public. Finally, City Council makes their final amendments, if necessary, within a public hearing as required by State Law and\n\nstages of each fund within each of the five different fund categories.\n\nCurrent Revenue-by Fund Type*\n\nEnterprise (Uti l ities & Ai rport) 29% General 51% Special Revenue 20%\n\n*Internal Service, Capital Const., and Debt Service Funds are excluded as they are funded by the other City funds' current revenue sources.\n\nOperating Expenditure Budget by Fund Type\n\nGeneral 48% Special Revenue 18% Ca p Cons t/Debt/Perm Funds 0% Enterprise Internal Svc. 22% 12%\n\nFY 17-18 ADOPTED BUDGET -

The IT  change is  most\n\nmost significant in the Transit, Water, Wastewater, Storm Water, and Airport Funds.   T he core department services are not changing to any significant degree in FY 17-18. To see this more clearly, a like-to-like comparison can be achieved by removing the Special Projects and IT staff budget from the FY 16-17 numbers above.

Actual assessed value (AV) for FY 16-17 grew 5.6% based largely on the addition of \u201cThe Retreat\u201d student housing development and no reductions in value at industrial properties. This increased the AV base for FY 17-18, but without significant new development expected to come on the tax\n\n18. City Council will levy the full amount of the permanent tax rate at $5.1067 per $1,000 of AV; the full local option levy rate of $0.8181 per $1,000 of AV; and $1,205,130 for voter approved general obligation  debt.

Property taxes are largely governed by the Oregon Constitution and limits placed into the Constitution by voters in 1990 (Measure 5) and 1997 (Measure 50). These limits have improved the predictability of tax bills for individual property owners, but they have also led to a number of inequities in the tax system,\n\nFor 10 of the last 20 years, the City\u2019s assessed value (AV) has grown less than the assumed 3%. For  the financial  planning  period,  AV,  and  revenue,  is  expected  to  grow 3%  annually.  The  full permanent rate of 5.1067 per $1,000 of AV is assumed. The full $0.8181 for the local option levy\n\naround the same \u2013 currently 95% of the levy each year. Additional  significant  revenues  are  from  Franchise  Fees,  projected  to  grow  2%  per  year;  and lodging taxes, projected to grow 3% per year. The FY 17-18 budget includes new revenue from\n\nExpenses\n\nExpenses Primary expenses are for operations in Library, Police, Fire, Parks and Recreation, and Land-use Planning. Smaller costs are for Economic Development, Mayor and City Council, Municipal Court,\n\nOpportunities/Challenges\n\nOpportunities/Challenges Property tax limits have kept annual growth in tax revenue at a lower rate than the increase in costs  to  maintain  current  services.  As  a  result,  the  City  has  controlled  costs  by  reducing  or eliminating programs and/or staff in most years since 2002, even as year-over-year spending has increased. Long-term relief from these property tax limits would require a State Constitutional amendment.  As  a  result,  the  City  is  exploring  alternative  revenue  sources  that  could  produce\n\nrevenue alternatives and make a recommendation to the City Council by early summer. The  General  Fund  financial  plan  is  built  on  a  model  that  matches  recurring  revenue  with recurring expenditures. This model allows decision makers to focus on the on-going operating costs for the organization without appearing to rely on one-time revenue or inflating costs with one-time projects (the green line). The model also includes \u201cnon-revenue and non-expenditure\u201d\n\nGENERal FUNd FiNaNcIal PLaN", "metadata": {"state": "or", "chunk_index": 17, "city": "corvallis", "filename":

These are all relatively stable revenue streams, and most rates have not been changed in  several  years.  The  fee  for  residential  parking  permits  increased  in  FY  16-17,  the  impact  of which  is  reflected  in  the  revised  revenue  projection.  Fine  revenue  fluctuates  the  most  and  is dependent  on  the  number  of  Parking  Enforcement  Officer  positions  filled;  revenue  estimates\n\nExpenses\n\nExpenses Three departments operate in this fund. Public Works is responsible for parking lot and meter maintenance,  parking  signage,  permit  sales,  and  collection  of  meter  revenue.  The  Police Department  is  responsible  for  parking  enforcement,  largely  through  monitoring  parking  and\n\nmonies owed.\n\nOpportunities/Challenges Expansion of residential parking districts has increased the workload for Enforcement Officers to  the  level  where  the  parking  restrictions  contained  throughout  the  city  are  not  all  being", "metadata": {"parser": "aryn", "filename": "or_corvallis_18.pdf", "chunk_index": 23, "city": "corvallis", "s3_key": "or_corvallis_18.pdf", "state": "or", "has_table": true, "year": 2018, "has_summary": true}}]}, {"state": "OR", "city": "Corvallis", "year": 2018, "expense": "Police", "budget_type": "p18", "budget": 13045780.0, "chunks": [{"text": "ty.

F unding the 9-1-1 Center at levels commensurate with user agency and community expectations is a fine balance between the increasing costs of necessary technology, infrastructure, staffing and operations, versus the limited general fund resources available to user agencies.  The current funding  model  of  CRCC  is  based  on  a  1983  Intergovernmental  Agreement  between  the  user agencies.  Due to increasing community service requirements and technological advances in the emergency communications systems statewide, this funding model is no longer viable to sustain ongoing operations.

The most significant change to the budget is in staffing. Three full time technical positions, previously in other departments, have been absorbed by the IT Department as part of an  ongoing  effort  to  streamline  and  centralize  IT  services.  In  addition,  some  roles  have  been converted to provide a more robust and effective Department. A Project Manager and Operations Supervisor have been created to replace vacant positions, and provide additional services. The GIS  group,  which  includes  1.0  FTE,  an  intern,  and  several  contracts,  have  moved  from  Public Works into the IT Department. IT now coordinates print services, including printing costs and contract costs that are charged back to user departments through ISCs. This allows for centralized management and contract negotiations of all printers and copiers throughout the City. The final major  budget  change is  the inclusion  of  the  Government  Access  Channel  21  TV  station\n\n| BUDGET BY FUND: | ACTUAL 2014-15 | ACTUAL 2015-16 | BUDGET 2016-17 | REVISED 2016-17 | ADOPTED 2017-18 | % CHANGE FROM 16-17 BUDGET |\n| BUDGET BY FUND: | ACTUAL 2014-15 | ACTUAL 2015-16 | BUDGET 2016-17 | REVISED 2016-17 | ADOPTED 2017-18 | % CHANGE FROM 16-17 BUDGET |\n| BUDGET BY FUND: | ACTUAL 2014-15 | ACTUAL 2015-16 | BUDGET 2016-17 | REVISED 2016-17 | ADOPTED 2017-18 | % CHANGE FROM 16-17 BUDGET |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Vehicle/Equip Reserve Fund | $ - | $ - | $ 1,212,190 | $ 200,000 | $ | -100.00% |\n| Tech & Communications Fund | - | - | 2,076,450 | 1,991,150 | 2,465,310 | 18.73% |\n| TOTAL | $ - | $ - | $ 3,288,640 | $ 2,191,150 | $ 2,465,310 | -25.04% |\n\nIn addition to the expenditures identified above, the IT Department will contribute $20,000\n\nI N F O R M A T I O N   T E C H N O L O G Y\n\nIn FY 17-18, the IT Department will have the following one-time special projects:\n\n| Finance/HR Information System | $ 803,070 |\n| --- | --- |\n| Police CAD/RMS Upgrade | 390,000 |\n| IT Hardware/Software | 100,000 |\n| Network Upgrades | 37,300 |\n| Website Upgrades | 40,000 |\n| Intranet Upgrades | 8,000 |\n| TOTAL | 1,378,370 |", "metadata": {"filename": "or_corvallis_18.pdf", "parser": "aryn", "state": "or", "s3_key": "or_corvallis_18.pdf", "year": 2018, "has_summary": false, "city": "corvallis", "has_table": true, "chunk_index": 67}}, {"text": "ITY LIVABILITY\n\nPARKS\tAND\tRECREATION\tDEPARTMENT\n\nCentral Park\n\nAquatics\n\nPARKS\tAND\tRECREATION\tDEPARTMENT\n\nFencing\n\nPickleball\n\nPARKS AND RECREATION DEPARTMENT\n\nD E P A R T M E N T\n\nMISSION STATEMENT\n\nBUDGET OVERVIEW\n\n|  | ACTUAL | ACTUAL | BUDGET | REVISED | ADOPTED | % CHANGE FROM 16-17 |\n|  | 2014-15 | 2015-16 | 2016-17 | 2016-17 | 2017-18 | BUDGET |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Revenue | Revenue | Revenue | Revenue | Revenue | Revenue | Revenue |\n| Property Taxes (2013 Levy) | $ 787,086 | $ 811,074 | $ 861,710 | $ 882,480 | $ 908,300 | 5.41% |\n| Licenses, Fees & Permits | 162,735 | 160,485 | 162,730 | 172,110 | 158,710 | -2.47% |\n| Charges for Service | 1,849,227 | 1,906,602 | 2,169,550 | 2,169,550 | 1,558,390 | -28.17% |\n| Intergovernmental | 14,211 | 22,966 | 107,400 | 107,400 | 7,400 | -93.11% |\n| All Other Dedicated Revenue | 224,365 | 254,286 | 450,370 | 695,110 | 91,500 | -79.68% |\n| Total Dedicated Revenue | $ 3,037,624 | $ 3,155,413 | $ 3,751,760 | $ 4,026,650 | $ 2,724,300 | -27.39% |\n| Expenditures | Expenditures | Expenditures | Expenditures | Expenditures | Expenditures | Expenditures |\n| Personnel Services | $ 3,805,548 | $ 4,090,077 | $ 4,471,710 | $ 4,422,540 | 4,342,580 S | -2.89% |\n| Materials and Services | 2,454,743 | 2,697,338 | 3,052,480 | 3,132,810 | 2,466,020 | -19.21% |\n| Capital Outlay | 9,361 | 25,861 | 35,000 | 35,000 | - | -100.00% |\n| Total Expenditures | $ 6,269,652 | $ 6,813,276 | $ 7,559,190 | $ 7,590,350 | $ 6,808,600 | -9.93% |\n| General Fund Revenue | $ 3,037,624 | $ 3,155,413 | $ 3,751,760 | $ 4,026,650 | $ 2,724,300 | -27.39% |\n| Other Fund Revenue | - | - | - | - | - | N/A |\n| Staffing Levels | 31.790 | 33.790 | 33.790 | 33.790 | 33.790 |  |\n\nThe budget structure has changed for FY 17-18.

due to the decrease in department staff from the consolidation of Information Technology (IT) services and/or the  separation  of  Special  Projects into its  own  department.  The IT  change is  most\n\nmost significant in the Transit, Water, Wastewater, Storm Water, and Airport Funds.   T he core department services are not changing to any significant degree in FY 17-18. To see this more clearly, a like-to-like comparison can be achieved by removing the Special Projects and IT staff budget from the FY 16-17 numbers above. That results in a FY 16-17 operating budget of $25,735,210. With this new base to compare to, the total FY 17-18 Adopted Budget increases by 0.6% over the previous fiscal year.
